        get_state function

        The agent gets to a new state or observation state is
        the information of the environment that an agent is in
        and observation is an actual image that the agent sees.

        step function -This function takes an action as an input and applies it to
        the environment, which leads to the environment transitioning to a new state.
        returns:
            - observation: The observation of the state of the environment.
            - reward: The reward that you can get from the environment after executing 
            the action that was given as the input to the step function.
            - done: Whether the episode has been terminated. If true, you may need to end the 
            simulation or reset the environment to restart the episode.
            - info: This provides additional information depending on the environment,
            such as number of lives left, or general information that may be conducive in debugging.
